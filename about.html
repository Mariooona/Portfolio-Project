            During my chemical technology and engeneering studies, I never
            thought will be interested working in IT field, but life changes, so
            did my interests. I have been working in various restourants as a
            chef for around 8 years and for last 1,5 years I've been thinking to
            test myself in tech. Half of the year have already passed since I've
            been teaching myself via SheCodes platform, and I realized that I
            want to learn more and do it for life.
            <br />
            <br />
            As I had an opportunity to work various jobs from young age, I am
            not afraid of the pressure and different situations you need to
            addapt to. I've learned to be both: a teamplayer and also work
            independently. I think working as a chef I was missing further
            self-development, as there is not that much to learn being in the
            same place for longer time period. I like all the challenges coding
            brings and being able to solve them gets me excited.
